        <h2>Exploration of Twitter Data Use in Transport Disruption Research</h2>
        <p>
        We are researching social media data in the context of transport disruption, using the Glasgow Commonwealth Games as a case study for planned and unplanned disruption. The project will directly address OECD Challenge 1 (reliability, validity and generalisability of new forms of data) and Challenge 3 (new forms of personal data and its transparency) by developing and propagating data mining and dissemination models in partnership with publc transport agencies. We also build upon research conducted in the dot.rural Informed Rural Passenger Project. We anticipate that this research will inform creativity and innovation in disruption planning and response strategies by impacted agencies, as well as responding to ESRC&acirc;&euro;&trade;s strategic priority of Influencing Behaviour and Informing interventions.

        </p>
        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <p>How can we develop more effective intervention strategies using socal mdia both as a platform for public communication, and as a rich source of data for understanding the passenger experience on a variety of transport modes? How can we develop more effective long-term approaches to information provision and service design? What is the relative importance of strong and weak kinship ties (Papangelis2014) to improved understanding of infrmation dispersion and the relative resilience, adaptability and vulnerability of different social segments? </p>

        <h2>Argumentation Mining from Social Media Text</h2>
        <p>
        Description: Various reports (OECD) highlight the need for new technologies to facilitate the drawing of insights from social media. The field of text analytics has made rapid progress in some areas such as sentiment analysis, but little progress on more complex tasks such as argumentation mining, which could facilitate researchers and policy makers in better understanding why people hold the opinions they do. A key reason for this lack of progress is the lack of resources such as corpora to facilitate machine learning and text simplification software (Siddharthan2006). Such resurce building is the key aim of this reserch, which is relevant to two ESRC strategic priority areas: &acirc;&euro;&#339;influencing behaviour and informing interventions&acirc;&euro;&#157; and a &acirc;&euro;&#339;vibrant and fair society&acirc;&euro;&#157;, as well as wider strategic interest in converting data to knowledge. Previous work only considers a binary classification of sentences in legal documents as belonging to an argument or not and identifies high-level organizational elements in argumentative discourse. We will leverage resources from our previous work on argumentation schemes for science; e.g. for Citation Analysis and Argumentative Zoning. </p>

        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <p>
        How suitable is the Toulmin scheme for annotating arguentation in social media texts? Can a reliable scheme and annotation manual be developed for such texts? To what extent are linguistic and compuational resources developed for text simplification and analysing argumentation in science useful for argument mining in social media?

        <h2>Provenance of Social Media Data</h2>
        <p>
        It has been widely recognized that the social science research community faces challenges associated with the reliability, statistical validity, and generalizability of data obtained from new sources, such as the Internet, which may raise qustions about the validity of research based on such data (OECD - Challenge 1). We argue that understanding the provenance of such data and its subsequent analysis could play a key role in addressing these challenges, by increasing transparency. This in turn could help improve the undestandability of the research, support assessment of analytical methods, and aid reproducibility (Cheney2012). This additional contextual information should also facilitate data reuse (OECD &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Challenge 9). Our recent experience of defining and applying the W3C PROV standard in a number of application domains (Corsar2014), and developing eInfrastructure for the social scences, equips us with the necessary expertise to investigate provenance in the social media context.

        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <p>
         What charcteristics of social media data should be captured to facilitate greater verification and reproducibility of research using such datasets? What are the appropriate conceptual models to describe these characteristics? How can existing prvenance models be employed to record the analyses performed using such social media data?
