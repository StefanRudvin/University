          <h1> Advaith Siddharthan</br> <small>Project: Argumentation Mining from Social Media Text</small></br><small>Favourite Number: 58</small></h1>

          <p>Bio: I am a SICSA senior lecturer in Computing Science. My research area is Computational Linguistics, and my research focus is on making information more accessible by exploiting results in Linguistics and Computer Science, including Information Retrieval and Machine Learning. My main interest is Natural Language Regeneration, where existing texts are automatically simplified and summarised to make the content more accessible. My recent research covers information extraction from scientific literature, citation analysis, multi-document and multilingual news summarization, text simplification, open-domain referring expression generation, natural language generation and computational creativity.</p>

            Description:   My research interests are interdisciplinary, spanning language, logic, law, and software development. I have published on the syntax and semantics of adverbs, deontic logic, case-based reasoning, ontologies, text analytics, controlled natural languages, and argumentation theory. The blog represents some of this work along with reports of discussions, reviews of literature, workshops/conferences, developing research, etc.  Most of my recent research is about what could be called the Argumentation Pipeline, developing tools to extract arguments from texts that are distributed on the Internet and then providing the arguments to tools to reason defeasibly with inconsistent knowledge.

            Bio: John Nelson is Professor of Transport Studies, Director of the Centre for Transport Research and leader for Intelligent Mobility in dot.rural. He is particularly interested in the application and evaluation of new technologies to improve public transport and current projects cover many aspects of mobility management including investigations of internet-based journey planners, flexible transport systems and Bus Rapid Transit. His research interests include: user requirements of both passengers and public transport operators and evaluating the impact of an enhanced information ecosystem on trip planning, activity patterns and longer-term behaviour change.

            Bio: Dr Caitlin D Cottrill is Lecturer in Digital Economy in the Department of Geography &amp; Environment at the University of Aberdeen and is a member of the universityâ€™s Centre for Transport Research. Her primary research interests are in the use of technology to encourage active and public transport use, and in the protection of personally identifying information. Her current projects include Social Journeys and the Transport &amp; Twitter project as part of the dot.rural ESRC social media award, both of which are examining the use and communication of data to enhance the customers public transport experience. Prior to joining Aberdeen, she served as project manager of the FMS, a smartphone-based household travel survey hosted by the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research &amp; Technology. She has previously worked as a transportation planner on projects related to the design and development of a regional public transport system with particular attention to access for the mobility impaired

          <p>
            Bio: Dr David Corsar is a Research Fellow in Intelligent Information Infrastructures at the Department of Computing Science.  His research focuses on knowledge management, provenance and quality assessment in systems that integrate humans with artificial intelligence algorithms and big data. These interests have been investigated in the context of: a real-time passenger information system for bus passengers in rural areas that combined open data with data crowd-sourced from passengers; a smart-city data platform in which data is created and maintained by citizens; and the use of social media as a channel for obtaining and communicating travel information.  As a member of the W3C Provenance Working Group, he was involved in developing a standard ontology for the interchange of provenance information on the Web. Dr Corsar was a co-organiser of the UK eScience Institute funded mini-theme on Provenance and Linked Open Data, lead investigator on a case study into issues surrounding Personal Privacy and the Web of Linked Data funded by the Framework for Responsible Research in ICT project, and co-applicant on the SSN+ grant Making Healthcare Data Sustainable: Challenges and Opportunities for the Semantic Web
